# landing-page

I'll create an entire web page for a project at The Odin Project.
I should have the skills I need to accomplish this. The point is to 
build the web page from scratch and get the various elements in 
more or less the right position relative to the rest.

For this assignment I'll be provided with two images: one is an image
of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the
fonts and colors weâ€™ve used.
